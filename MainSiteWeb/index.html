    <!-- Company history and introduction paragraph -->
    <p>Mkhize & Sons Furniture Repairs began in 1995 when our founder, Joseph Mkhize, noticed how many beautiful pieces of furniture were being discarded simply because of minor damages or wear. With nothing but his grandfather's woodworking tools and a passion for preservation, Joseph started repairing furniture for friends and family in his small garage.</p>
